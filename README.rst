ckanext-introjs
===============

This plugin adds `intro.js` goodness to CKAN - a library to create better
introductions for websites and features with a step-by-step guide for your
UI (so the `intro.js` website says - https://usablica.github.io/intro.js/).

Originally created for use on civil servants in NHS England with mixed
results.

YMMV - please feel free to fork this repository.
